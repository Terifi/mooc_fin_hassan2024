The exercises are submitted via GitHub, and by marking the exercises as done in the "my submissions" tab of the submission application.

The exercises are submitted one part at a time. When you have submitted the exercises for a part of the course you can no longer submit undone exercises for the same part.

Note that in this part, there are more exercises besides those found below. Do not submit your work until you have completed all of the exercises you want to submit for the part.

You may submit all the exercises of this course into the same repository, or use multiple repositories. If you submit exercises of different parts into the same repository, please use a sensible naming scheme for the directories.

One very functional file structure for the submission repository is as follows:

part0
part1
  courseinfo
  unicafe
  anecdotes
part2
  phonebook
  countriescopy
See this example submission repository!

For each part of the course, there is a directory, which further branches into directories containing a series of exercises, like "unicafe" for part 1.

Most of the exercises of the course build a larger application, eg. courseinfo, unicafe and anecdotes in this part, bit by bit. It is enough to submit the completed application. You can make a commit after each exercise, but that is not compulsory. For example the course info app is built in exercises 1.1.-1.5. It is just the end result after 1.5 that you need to submit!

For each web application for a series of exercises, it is recommended to submit all files relating to that application, except for the directory node_modules.
